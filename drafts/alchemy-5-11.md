# Elixir Grimoires üúÖ
I‚Äôm pretty crazed about learning and spend a good deal of time vetting resources for my learning. Last year I set out in earnest to learn the Elixir programming language. Here‚Äôs a review of the best resources I found:

- **[Elixir Getting Started: Introduction](http://elixir-lang.org/getting-started/introduction.html)**

    Suprisingly (or not, given the Elixir teams focus on ) these are awesome. They cover basic language semantics and then teach more advanced concepts through a few examples that flow through into the later more advanced topics. I dipped in and out of this during my first few months fairly often. Follow along with the examples by actually getting them to run. After #5 I came back to the section on Mix and OTP to review.
- **Dave Thomas‚Äô Programming Elixir**

    This is a solid intro to the language. I found the more advanced concepts he covers around concurrency and OTP hard to wrap my head around until later, but I think it covers much of the same ground as #1 and was a nice reinforcer.
- **Exercism Elixir + Elixir Slack**

  At this point you need to get you hands dirty and solve some problems. I did examples as I went along, but Exercism pushes you a bit more.  Whenever I had real trouble with something, the #beginners channel of the elixir slack was a great place to go for help.
- **[Take off with Elixir](https://bigmachine.io/products/take-off-with-elixir/)**

  Great series of practical examples taught through videos and text. More learning by building. Super interesting for me because I‚Äôm a wannabee space programmer (please please never let me program spaceships!) and it uses space programming for the examples

- **[Little Elixir and OTP Guidboook](https://www.manning.com/books/the-little-elixir-and-otp-guidebook)**

  This book is GREAT!!  It was the first time I really started to understanding concurrency, GenServers, and some of the other OTP stuff, which the language is really driving you towards.

**Bonus:‚ú®**

 I think its pretty important to understand the ecosystem in which you program, and Elixir is ultimately a BEAM language, so understand Erlang + its runtime are super important.

**[Joe Armstrong thesis on building resilient software](http://erlang.org/download/armstrong_thesis_2003.pdf)**

This sounds really technical and dense, and it kinda is, but I found it worth slogging through as it really helped me understand why Erlang is how it is

**[Learn you Some Erlang for Great Good](http://learnyousomeerlang.com/) (book and online)**

This a really great book, whose tone is amazing and whose author is lovely and whose drawings are joyousüêô
